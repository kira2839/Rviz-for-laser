In the Bug2 part, the fitted line may not reflect the exact shape of the obstacle and the robot
may come too close to the wall, so it has to keep rotating a small angle each time this happens.

Another thing is when the robot wallfollows a bit and comes parallel to another wall it has to move along it as by definition of Bug2 the robot has to be constantly in one of the 2 states wallfollow or goalseek and in this case the robot isnt on the m-line so it moves along the wall till it reaches it.
